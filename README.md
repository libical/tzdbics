# IANA Time Zone Database to iCalendar Translation Database

This repo tracks releases of the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) together with the corresponding translations to the iCalendar format (as defined in RFC 5545).

The translation is performed using [libical's VZIC utility](https://github.com/libical/vzic).
